In this paper by Giuliano Benenti and Giuliano Strini the authors describe how to build quantum circuits to implement the unitary operator $U=e^{-i \Delta t H}$ for different external potentials and initial conditions.

The pdf is a print of the Mathematica notebook implementing some of these setups.
